Your team has determined they need to monitor telemetry in your environment. You know that Grafana can do that as a visualization tool, so you plan to deploy it on a server as a daemon.

Deploy Grafana and ensure that it is running on your server.

### Solution

<summary>Solution</summary>
  
Refer to the [Grafana Docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/) for latest installation instructions.

Install the required packages and Grafana GPG key.

```plain
apt install -y apt-transport-https
```{{exec}}

```plain
apt install -y software-properties-common wget
```{{exec}}

```plain
wget -q -O /usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key
```{{exec}}

Add the Grafana repository.
  
```plain
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grafana.key] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```{{exec}}
  
Finally, we're ready to install Grafana:
  
```plain
apt update
# Install the latest Enterprise release:
apt install -y grafana-enterprise
```{{exec}}

Now that you've installed Grafana, let's make sure it's started.

```plain
systemctl daemon-reload
```{{exec}}

```plain
systemctl start grafana-server
```{{exec}}

Verify that the server is serving on port 3000 (the default port)

```plain
systemctl status grafana-server --no-pager
ss -ntulp | grep grafana
ss -ntulp | grep 3000
```{{exec}}

We can also check that the external Web UI is available and change the default password.

{{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}

Change the password. Default User: admin and Password: admin

Feel free to look around in the Web UI and then continue on to the next part of the lab.
